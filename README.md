Project Pitch: "Event Pulse"ff

Name of the Project: Event Pulse

Team Members:
- Heidi Elsayed
- Neven Shukri
- Asmaa Elmallah

Description of the Project:
Event Pulse is a frontend-only web application designed to create and publish events with details such as title, date, time, location, description, and category. Also, to transform the way users search for and explore events.

Learning Objectives:
- Gain proficiency in frontend web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- Learn user interface design principles & apply them in the context of a real-world projects.
- Understand the importance of user experience & usability testing in web development.
- Explore techniques for integrating third-party APIs and services in a frontend-only application.




Technologies Used:
The technology stack used is primarily centered around web development using JavaScript and related frameworks and libraries. Here's a breakdown:

1. JavaScript (JS):
   - JavaScript is the primary programming language used for web development. It's used for both client-side & server-side development.
   
2. React:
   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's widely used for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic web interfaces.
   
3. React Router:
   - React Router is a library for routing in React applications. It allows developers to manage navigation and URL changes in a React application.
   
4. Node.js:
   - Though not explicitly mentioned, Node.js is often used for running JavaScript on the server side. It's commonly used for building backend services, APIs, and server-side rendering in React applications.
   
5. CSS:
   - CSS is used for styling the HTML elements. It's responsible for defining the visual presentation of the web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and more.
   
6. HTML:
   - HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It's used for defining the structure & content of web pages.



7. npm and Yarn:
   - npm (Node Package Manager) and Yarn are package managers for Node.js and JavaScript. They are used for installing, managing, and updating dependencies for the project.
   
8. ESLint:
   - ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns or code errors in JavaScript code. It's commonly used to enforce coding standards and improve code quality.
   
9. Jest and Testing Library:
  - Jest: is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook. 
- Testing Library: is a set of utilities for testing React components. They are used for writing and running tests to ensure the correctness of the application.

Overall, the technology stack consists of modern web development tools and frameworks commonly used for building robust and interactive web applications.


Challenges Already Identified:
1. Designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for event listings and search functionalities.
2. Implementing efficient state management in React to handle dynamic data and user interactions.
3. Integrating maps and location services to provide users with accurate events locations and directions.
4. Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design for optimal user experience on different devices.



Schedule of Work:
We will utilize a Kanban board to organize our tasks and track progress. The schedule is divided into four phases:

1. Planning and Design (Days 1-5): Define project requirements, create wireframes, and design the user interface. Set up the development environment and establish version control.

2. Frontend Development (Days 6-14): Implement the frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Focus on creating the core functionality of event listings, search, and user interactions.


3. Testing and Iteration (Days 15-20): Conduct thorough testing to ensure functionality, performance, and usability. Gather user feedback and iterate on design based on testing results.

4. Deployment and Documentation (Days 21-27): Deploy the application to a hosting service and document the development process. Prepare for potential future enhancements or scalability.


With EventPulse, we aim to deliver an experience that empowers users to find the events they care about effortlessly. Thank you for considering our project. We are excited to bring EventPulse to life.
