import "./App.css"
// This line imports the CSS file App.css. It's likely used to apply styles to the components rendered in this file.

import Pages from "./components/pages/Pages"
// This line imports a component named Pages from the file located at `"./components/pages/Pages"`.

function App() {
  return <Pages />
}
// This declares a functional component named `App`. It returns the `Pages` component. 
// Functional components in React are JavaScript functions that return JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React to describe what the UI should look like).

export default App
// This exports the `App` component as the default export of this file. 
// This means that when other files import from this one using `import App from "./App"`, they will get the `App` component.
